## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Backend (server/routes/reports.js)

**Updated `/api/reports/cashier-summary` endpoint:**

```javascript
// BEFORE: Limited cashier data
const sales = await prisma.order.aggregate({...});
const totalItems = await prisma.orderItem.aggregate({...});
// Separate queries, limited data

// AFTER: Same structure as Admin endpoint
const orders = await prisma.order.findMany({
  where: {
    userId: userId, // ✅ Filter for specific cashier
    status: 'COMPLETED',
    ...(start && end ? { createdAt: buildDateFilter(start, end) } : {})
  },
  include: {
    orderItems: {
      include: {
        product: {
          include: {
            category: true // ✅ Full product details
          }
        }
      }
    },
    user: {
      select: {
        id: true,
        name: true,
        username: true,
        shiftId: true // ✅ Complete user info
      }
    }
  },
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' }
});
```

### Data Structure Now Matches Admin:

```javascript
res.json({
  success: true,
  data: {
    totalRevenue,        // ✅ Same calculation method
    totalOrders,         // ✅ Same calculation method  
    totalItems,          // ✅ Same calculation method
    averageOrder,        // ✅ Same calculation method
    dailySales: Object.values(dailySales), // ✅ Same format
    paymentMethods: Object.values(paymentMethodBreakdown), // ✅ Same breakdown
    orders: orders       // ✅ Full order details like Admin
  }
});
```

## 🔒 Security & Data Isolation

### Maintained Security:
- ✅ **Cashier Filter:** `userId: req.user.id` ensures data isolation

### Data Isolation Verified:
- Cashiers see **only their own orders**

## 🧪 Test Results

### What to Verify:
1. **Login as Cashier** → Go to Sales Reports
2. **Sales Summary tab** → Should show comprehensive data ✅
3. **All Orders section** → Should show detailed orders ✅
4. **Data verification** → Should only show that cashier's orders ✅
5. **Compare with Admin** → Should have same data structure ✅
