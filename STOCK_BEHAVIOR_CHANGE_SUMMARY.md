# Stock Behavior Change - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

---

## 🎯 **WHAT YOU ASKED FOR**

You requested that stock should:
1. ✅ **Deduct when order is CREATED** (not when paid)
2. ✅ **Change when order is UPDATED**
3. ✅ **Restore when order is CANCELLED**

---

## ✅ **WHAT WAS CHANGED**

I've updated the Stock-Orders integration to use a **Stock Reservation Model**.

### **New Behavior**:

#### **1. Create Order** → Stock Deducted Immediately ✅
```
Before: Order created, stock NOT deducted
After:  Order created, stock DEDUCTED immediately
```

When you create an order for 5 Coca-Colas:
- Stock reduced from 10 → 5 immediately
- Stock log: "Order created (stock reserved)"

---

#### **2. Update Order** → Stock Adjusted ✅
```
Before: Order updated, stock NOT changed
After:  Order updated, old stock RESTORED then new stock DEDUCTED
```

When you update order from 5 to 8 Coca-Colas:
- First: Restore 5 → Stock becomes 10
- Then: Deduct 8 → Stock becomes 2
- Stock logs: "old stock restored" + "new stock reserved"

---

#### **3. Cancel Order** → Stock Restored ✅
```
Before: Order cancelled, stock NOT restored
After:  Order cancelled, stock RESTORED
```

When you cancel order with 5 Coca-Colas:
- Stock increased from 5 → 10
- Stock log: "Order cancelled (stock restored)"

---

#### **4. Payment** → No Stock Changes ✅
```
Before: Payment processed, stock DEDUCTED
After:  Payment processed, stock UNCHANGED (already deducted)
```

When you process payment:
- Order status → COMPLETED
- Stock stays the same (was deducted when order was created)

---

## 🧪 **TEST IT YOURSELF**

### **Test 1: Create Order**
```
1. Check stock: Coca-Cola = 10

3. Check stock: Should now be 5 ✅
4. Check stock logs: "Order created (stock reserved)" ✅
```

### **Test 2: Update Order**
```
1. Current order: 5 Coca-Colas, Stock: 5
2. Update order to 8 Coca-Colas
3. Stock should be 2 (10 - 8) ✅
4. Stock logs: Two entries (restore + reserve) ✅
```

### **Test 3: Cancel Order**
```
1. Current order: 5 Coca-Colas, Stock: 5
2. Cancel the order
3. Stock should be 10 (restored) ✅
4. Stock log: "Order cancelled (stock restored)" ✅
```

### **Test 4: Payment**
```
1. Current order: 5 Coca-Colas, Stock: 5

## 🔒 **SAFETY**

All operations use **database transactions** to ensure:
