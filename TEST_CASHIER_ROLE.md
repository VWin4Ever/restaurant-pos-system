## Test 5: Permission Consistency ✅

### Backend API Test (using browser console or Postman):

```javascript
// Test Products Read
GET /api/products
// Should work for Cashier ✅

// Test Products Update (without permission)
PUT /api/products/1
// Should return 403 Forbidden ❌

// Test Products Update (with custom permission)
PUT /api/products/1
// Should work ✅ (after granting products.update)
```

## Browser Console Tests

### Check User Permissions
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12)
const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('token'));
console.log('User:', user);

// Check if permission check works
// (Use this in Components that have useAuth)
const { hasPermission } = useAuth();
console.log('Can read products:', hasPermission('products.read')); // Should be true for Cashier
console.log('Can update products:', hasPermission('products.update')); // Depends on custom permission
```

---

## Database Verification

### Check Cashier Permissions in Database

```sql
-- See all permissions for a cashier
SELECT u.username, u.role, up.permission
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN user_permissions up ON u.id = up.userId
WHERE u.role = 'CASHIER';

-- Check for old permission names (should be empty after migration)
SELECT * FROM user_permissions 
WHERE permission IN ('products.edit', 'categories.edit', 'products.view', 'categories.view', 'settings.view', 'stock.update');
```

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Permission denied" when editing with custom permission

**Cause:** Permission cache might not be updated  
**Solution:** 
1. Logout and login again
2. OR wait 5 minutes (cache TTL)
3. OR restart the server

### Issue: Old permission names still in database

**Solution:** Run the migration SQL:
```sql
UPDATE user_permissions SET permission = 'products.update' WHERE permission = 'products.edit';
UPDATE user_permissions SET permission = 'categories.update' WHERE permission = 'categories.edit';
```

### Issue: Routes still checking for old permissions

**Solution:** Clear browser cache and hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## API Endpoint Tests (Postman/Insomnia)

### 1. Login as Cashier
```
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "username": "cashier1",
  "password": "password"
}
```
Save the token from response.

### 2. Get Products (Should work)
```
GET /api/products
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
Expected: 200 OK with products list

### 3. Update Product (Should fail without permission)
```
PUT /api/products/1
Authorization: Bearer <token>
{
  "name": "Updated Product",
  "price": 10.99,
  ...
}
```
Expected: 403 Forbidden (unless cashier has `products.update` permission)

### 4. Get Categories (Should work)
```
GET /api/categories
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
Expected: 200 OK with categories list

---

## Success Criteria ✅

All of these should be TRUE:
- ✅ Cashiers can view products and categories
- ✅ Cashiers cannot edit products/categories by default
- ✅ Cashiers WITH custom permissions CAN edit
- ✅ Admin routes are blocked for cashiers
- ✅ No console errors related to permissions
- ✅ Permission checks are consistent across frontend and backend
- ✅ Documentation matches actual behavior

---

## Performance Check

The permission system uses caching:
- Cache TTL: 5 minutes
- Permissions are cached per user
- Login fetches fresh permissions

**Expected Performance:**
- First permission check: ~10-50ms (database query)
- Subsequent checks: <1ms (cached)
- No noticeable lag in UI

---

## Automated Test Commands

```bash
# Start the application
npm run dev

# In a separate terminal, you can run API tests
# (if you have test scripts set up)
npm run test:api

# Check for linting errors
npm run lint
```

---

## Final Verification

After completing all tests, the system should:
1. ✅ No errors in browser console
2. ✅ No errors in server console
3. ✅ All Cashier features work as expected
4. ✅ Custom permissions work correctly
5. ✅ Admin restrictions are enforced
6. ✅ Performance is good (no lag)

---

**Test Status:** Ready for Testing  
**Expected Duration:** 15-20 minutes for complete testing  
**Priority:** High (Core functionality)
