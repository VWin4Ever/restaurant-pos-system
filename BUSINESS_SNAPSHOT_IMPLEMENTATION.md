# Business Snapshot Implementation for Historical Accuracy

## Overview
This implementation adds business snapshot functionality to ensure that invoices and receipts show the business information that was accurate at the time of order creation, rather than current settings.

## Problem Solved
- **Before**: If business settings (name, address, tax rate, etc.) changed, all historical invoices would show the new information
- **After**: Each order captures a snapshot of business settings at creation time, ensuring historical accuracy

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Changes
**File**: `server/prisma/schema.prisma`
```prisma
model Order {
  // ... existing fields ...
  businessSnapshot Json?    // Store business settings at time of order creation
  // ... existing fields ...
}
```

### 2. Backend Changes

#### Helper Function
**File**: `server/routes/orders.js`
```javascript
const getBusinessSettings = async () => {
  const settingsRecord = await prisma.settings.findUnique({
    where: { category: 'business' }
  });
  
  const defaultBusinessSettings = {
    restaurantName: 'Restaurant POS',
    address: '123 Main Street, City, State 12345',
    phone: '+1 (555) 123-4567',
    email: 'info@restaurant.com',
    taxRate: 8.5,
    currency: 'USD',
    timezone: 'America/New_York'
  };
  
  return settingsRecord?.data || defaultBusinessSettings;
};
```

#### Order Creation
- Captures business settings snapshot when order is created
- Uses snapshot for tax calculations
- Stores snapshot in `businessSnapshot` field

#### Order Updates
- Preserves existing business snapshot
- Uses original snapshot for tax calculations (maintains historical accuracy)
- Creates snapshot for legacy orders that don't have one

### 3. Frontend Changes

#### Invoice Modal
**File**: `client/src/components/orders/InvoiceModal.js`
```javascript
// Use business snapshot from order if available, otherwise use current settings
const businessSnapshot = order.businessSnapshot || {};
const currentBusiness = settings.business || {};
const business = businessSnapshot.restaurantName ? businessSnapshot : currentBusiness;
const taxRate = business.taxRate || 0;
```

## Business Logic Flow

### New Orders
1. Order created → Business settings captured in `businessSnapshot`
2. Invoice generated → Uses snapshot data
3. Settings changed later → Invoice still shows original data

### Existing Orders (Legacy)
1. Order exists without snapshot → Invoice uses current settings
2. Order updated → Snapshot created if missing
3. Future invoices → Use snapshot data

### Order Updates
1. Order modified → Original snapshot preserved
2. Tax recalculated → Uses original tax rate from snapshot
3. Historical accuracy maintained

## Benefits

### Legal Compliance
- **Tax Accuracy**: Tax rates are preserved as they were at the time of sale
- **Business Info**: Restaurant name, address, contact info preserved
- **Audit Trail**: Complete historical record of business settings

### Customer Service
- **Dispute Resolution**: Can show exactly what was on the receipt at time of sale
- **Consistency**: Customers see the same information on receipts and invoices

### Business Operations
- **Historical Analysis**: Can track how business settings changed over time
- **Reporting Accuracy**: Financial reports reflect actual rates at time of transaction

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Implementation (Current)
- ✅ Database schema updated
- ✅ Backend logic implemented
- ✅ Frontend invoice logic updated
- ✅ New orders capture snapshots

### Phase 2: Legacy Data (Optional)
- Existing orders without snapshots use current settings
- When orders are updated, snapshots are created
- Gradual migration to full historical accuracy

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Future)
- Business settings change history
- Bulk snapshot creation for legacy orders
- Settings versioning system

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **New Order Creation**: Verify snapshot is captured
2. **Invoice Generation**: Verify historical data is used
3. **Settings Changes**: Verify old invoices remain unchanged
4. **Order Updates**: Verify snapshot is preserved
5. **Legacy Orders**: Verify fallback to current settings

### Test Script
Run `node test-business-snapshot.js` to verify implementation.

## Configuration

### Default Settings
If no business settings exist in the database, the system uses:
```javascript
{
  restaurantName: 'Restaurant POS',
  address: '123 Main Street, City, State 12345',
  phone: '+1 (555) 123-4567',
  email: 'info@restaurant.com',
  taxRate: 8.5,
  currency: 'USD',
  timezone: 'America/New_York'
}
```

### Snapshot Data Structure
The `businessSnapshot` field contains:
```javascript
{
  restaurantName: string,
  address: string,
  phone: string,
  email: string,
  taxRate: number,
  currency: string,
  timezone: string
}
```

## Best Practices

### For Developers
- Always use the helper function `getBusinessSettings()` for consistency
- Preserve existing snapshots when updating orders
- Handle missing snapshots gracefully in frontend

### For Business Users
- Update business settings in Settings page
- New orders will automatically capture current settings
- Historical invoices will maintain their original information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Snapshots**: Legacy orders use current settings
2. **Tax Rate Changes**: Historical orders maintain original rates
3. **Business Info Updates**: Old invoices show original info

### Solutions
1. Update legacy orders to create snapshots
2. Verify business settings are saved correctly
3. Check invoice rendering logic

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Settings History**: Track all business setting changes
2. **Bulk Migration**: Create snapshots for all legacy orders
3. **Version Control**: Multiple versions of business settings
4. **Export/Import**: Backup and restore business settings
5. **Audit Log**: Track who changed settings and when
