# ✅ Pending Orders - Fixed for Cashiers

## Issue Fixed
**Cashiers were seeing ALL pending orders instead of just their own!**

---

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### Backend Fix (server/routes/reports.js)
```javascript
// BEFORE: Showed ALL pending orders ❌
const pendingOrders = await prisma.order.count({
  where: {
    status: 'PENDING'
  }
});

// AFTER: Shows only cashier's pending orders ✅
const pendingOrders = await prisma.order.count({
  where: {
    userId: userId,  // ✅ Filtered by cashier
    status: 'PENDING'
  }
});
```

### Frontend Update (client/src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.js)
```javascript
// Updated subtitle to clarify for cashiers
subtitle={user?.role === 'CASHIER' ? "My pending orders" : "Awaiting payment"}
```

---

## ✅ Result

### Before
- Cashier A creates 2 pending orders
- Cashier B creates 3 pending orders
- **Both cashiers see: 5 pending orders** ❌ (WRONG!)

### After
- Cashier A creates 2 pending orders
- Cashier B creates 3 pending orders
- **Cashier A sees: 2 pending orders** ✅ (Their own)
- **Cashier B sees: 3 pending orders** ✅ (Their own)
- **Admin sees: 5 pending orders** ✅ (All)

## 🧪 Test It

1. Login as **Cashier A** → Create 2 orders, leave them PENDING
2. Check dashboard → Should show **2 pending orders**
3. Login as **Cashier B** → Create 1 order, leave it PENDING
4. Check dashboard → Should show **1 pending order**
5. Login as **Admin** → Dashboard should show **3 pending orders**
