# Stock-Orders Connection Checkup Report

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**System**: POS Restaurant System  
**Component**: Stock-Orders Integration

---

## 🔍 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The Stock-Orders integration has been thoroughly reviewed and tested. The system is **mostly working correctly** with **one critical race condition identified and FIXED**.

### **Overall Status**: ✅ **NOW FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

---

## 📋 **INTEGRATION POINTS TESTED**

### 1️⃣ **Order Creation** ✅ WORKING
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/orders`  
**Behavior**: 
- Validates stock availability BEFORE creating order
- Returns error if insufficient stock with available quantity
- Stock is NOT deducted at creation (correct behavior)
- Only validates products with `needStock: true`

**Test Result**: ✅ **PASS**

---

### 2️⃣ **Order Update** ✅ WORKING  
**Endpoint**: `PUT /api/orders/:id`  
**Behavior**:
- Only works on PENDING orders
- Smart stock calculation: `availableStock = currentStock + quantityAlreadyInOrder`
- Allows modifying order within available stock limits
- Prevents updates if insufficient stock

**Test Result**: ✅ **PASS**

---

### 3️⃣ **Payment Processing** ✅ **FIXED**
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/orders/:id/payment`  
**Behavior**:
- ✅ **NOW** validates stock before deduction (FIXED!)
- Deducts stock from inventory
- Creates stock log with order number
- Uses transaction for atomic operations
- Prevents negative stock with Math.max(0, ...)

**Test Result**: ⚠️ **HAD ISSUE** → ✅ **NOW FIXED**

**Issue Found**: Race condition allowed negative stock if stock was manually adjusted between order creation and payment.

**Fix Applied**: Added stock validation before deduction in transaction.

---

### 4️⃣ **Order Cancellation** ✅ WORKING
**Endpoint**: `PATCH /api/orders/:id/cancel`  
**Behavior**:
- Only cancels PENDING orders
- No stock restoration needed (stock never deducted from pending orders)
- COMPLETED orders cannot be cancelled (correct)

**Test Result**: ✅ **PASS**

---

## 🔧 **FIX APPLIED**

### **Critical Issue**: Race Condition in Payment Processing

**Problem**:
```
1. Customer orders 5 Coca-Colas (Stock: 10) ✅
2. Admin manually adjusts stock to 3 ⚠️
3. Customer pays → Stock becomes -2 ❌ NEGATIVE!
```

### **Solution Implemented**:

**File**: `server/routes/orders.js`  
**Lines**: 499-510, 534

```javascript
// ADDED: Stock validation before deduction
for (const item of order.orderItems) {
  if (item.product.needStock && item.product.stock) {
    if (item.product.stock.quantity < item.quantity) {
      throw new Error(
        `Insufficient stock for ${item.product.name}. ` +
        `Required: ${item.quantity}, Available: ${item.product.stock.quantity}. ` +
        `Stock may have been adjusted since order creation. Please update the order or restock before payment.`
      );
    }
  }
}

// UPDATED: Safety check to prevent negative stock
const newQuantity = Math.max(0, item.product.stock.quantity - item.quantity);
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Prevents negative stock
- ✅ Clear error messages for users
- ✅ Transaction rollback on error
- ✅ No data corruption
