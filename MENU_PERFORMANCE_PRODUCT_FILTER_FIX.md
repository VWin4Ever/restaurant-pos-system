# üçΩÔ∏è Menu Performance Product Filter Fix

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED - Menu Performance now shows selected products**

---

## üêõ **The Problem**

When filtering by products in Menu Performance report:
- **Before**: Only showed products that had sales in the filtered orders
- **Issue**: Selected products with zero sales were completely hidden
- **User Expectation**: Should show all selected products, even with zero sales

---

## ‚úÖ **The Solution**

### **Backend Fix** (`server/routes/reports.js`)

**Added logic to include selected products even with zero sales:**

```javascript
// Get filter IDs to check if specific products are selected
const productIds = parseFilterArray(req.query['productIds[]'] || req.query.productIds);

// ... existing logic to process orders ...

// If specific products are filtered, include them even with zero sales
if (productIds.length > 0) {
  const selectedProducts = await prisma.product.findMany({
    where: { id: { in: productIds } },
    include: { category: true }
  });
  
  selectedProducts.forEach(product => {
    if (!itemSales[product.id]) {
      itemSales[product.id] = {
        id: product.id,
        name: product.name,
        category: product.category.name,
        quantity: 0,
        revenue: 0,
        averagePrice: 0
      };
    }
  });
}
```

### **Frontend Enhancements** (`client/src/components/reports/SalesReports.js`)

#### **1. Filter Info Banner**
```javascript
{filters.productIds && filters.productIds.length > 0 && (
  <div className="bg-orange-50 border border-orange-200 rounded-lg p-4">
    <div className="flex items-center">
      <span className="text-orange-600 text-lg mr-2">üçΩÔ∏è</span>
      <div>
        <p className="text-orange-800 font-medium">Filtered by Products</p>
        <p className="text-orange-600 text-sm">
          Showing performance for {filters.productIds.length} selected product(s)
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

#### **2. Enhanced Chart Display**
- Shows placeholder when no sales data
- Better handling of empty states

#### **3. Enhanced Table Display**
- **Zero Sales Indicator**: Products with zero sales show "No Sales" badge
- **Visual Distinction**: Zero-sales rows have reduced opacity
- **Complete Data**: All selected products are always visible

```javascript
<tr className={`hover:bg-gray-50 ${item.quantity === 0 ? 'opacity-60' : ''}`}>
  <td className="px-6 py-4 whitespace-nowrap text-sm font-medium text-gray-900">
    {item.name}
    {item.quantity === 0 && (
      <span className="ml-2 text-xs text-orange-600 bg-orange-100 px-2 py-1 rounded-full">
        No Sales
      </span>
    )}
  </td>
  // ... other columns
</tr>
```
