## üîë ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE (Memorize!)

### **Technology Stack:**
```
FRONTEND:  React.js + Tailwind CSS
BACKEND:   Node.js + Express.js + Prisma ORM
DATABASE:  MySQL
SECURITY:  JWT + bcrypt
```

### **Why This Stack?**
- **React:** Component-based, efficient rendering
- **Node.js:** JavaScript full-stack, non-blocking I/O
- **MySQL:** ACID compliance, reliable for transactions
- **Prisma:** Type-safe queries, SQL injection prevention
- **JWT:** Stateless authentication, scalable
- **bcrypt:** Secure password hashing

### **Architecture:**
- Client-Server model
- MVC pattern
- RESTful API
- Separated concerns

### **Security:**
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens (who you are)
- **Authorization:** RBAC - Role-Based Access Control (what you can do)
- **Passwords:** bcrypt hashing with salt
- **SQL Injection:** Prevented by Prisma ORM

### **Key Features:**
1. Role-based access (Admin/Cashier)
2. Real-time order management
3. Automatic stock validation & deduction
4. Profit margin tracking
5. Comprehensive reporting
6. Audit trail (all actions logged)

### **Business Logic:**
- **Order Creation:** Validates stock, updates table status
- **Payment:** Deducts stock, generates invoice, frees table
- **Stock:** Tracked for drinks only, logged every change
- **Profit:** Revenue - Cost, tracked per item

## üé§ MEMORIZE THESE STATEMENTS:

### **Opening (30 seconds):**
> "Good day. I'm presenting a Restaurant POS System - a full-stack web application built with React, Node.js, and MySQL. It features JWT authentication and role-based access control with two roles: Cashier for daily operations and Admin for system management. Let me demonstrate both roles."

### **Closing (30 seconds):**
> "This demonstrates full-stack development with JWT authentication, role-based security, real-time stock management, and comprehensive business reporting. The architecture ensures scalability, security through bcrypt and Prisma ORM, and data integrity. Questions?"

---

## ‚ùì MOST LIKELY QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:

### **1. "What technology stack did you use?"**
**Answer:** "React for frontend, Node.js with Express for backend, MySQL for database. I used Prisma ORM for type-safe queries and SQL injection prevention, JWT for authentication, and bcrypt for password hashing."

### **2. "How does authentication work?"**
**Answer:** "JWT token-based authentication. User logs in, server validates credentials with bcrypt, creates a signed JWT token, client stores it and includes it in all requests. Server validates token on each request. It's stateless and scalable."

### **3. "How do you ensure security?"**
**Answer:** "Multiple layers: JWT for authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, role-based access control for authorization, Prisma ORM to prevent SQL injection, and server-side validation of all inputs."

### **4. "Why MySQL?"**
**Answer:** "MySQL provides ACID compliance essential for financial transactions. It ensures data integrity, supports complex relationships, and is reliable and widely adopted in industry."

### **5. "When is stock deducted?"**
**Answer:** "Stock is validated during order creation but only deducted when payment is processed. This prevents stock being locked by pending orders and allows cancellations without affecting inventory."

### **6. "How is profit calculated?"**
**Answer:** "Each product has a cost price and selling price. Profit equals revenue minus cost. For each order, we sum up individual item profits. Reports aggregate this with profit margin percentages."

### **7. "Can it handle multiple users?"**
**Answer:** "Yes. MySQL handles concurrent transactions with ACID properties. JWT allows multiple authenticated sessions. Critical operations use database transactions to prevent race conditions."

### **8. "How would you scale this?"**
**Answer:** "The separated frontend and backend allow independent scaling. We could add load balancing, database indexing, caching with Redis, and database replication. JWT authentication is already stateless and scalable."
