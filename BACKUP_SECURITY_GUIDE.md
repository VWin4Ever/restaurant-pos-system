# üîí Backup Security Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented for the Restaurant POS backup system.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features Implemented

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization**
- ‚úÖ **Permission-based access**: Requires `settings.backup` permission
- ‚úÖ **Role-based restrictions**: Only admins can restore backups
- ‚úÖ **User tracking**: All backup operations are logged with user ID
- ‚úÖ **Session validation**: Validates user session for all operations

### 2. **File Security**
- ‚úÖ **Secure permissions**: Backup files set to 600 (owner read/write only)
- ‚úÖ **Directory protection**: Backup directory set to 700 (owner access only)
- ‚úÖ **Filename sanitization**: Prevents path traversal attacks
- ‚úÖ **Size validation**: Maximum backup size limit (100MB)

### 3. **Audit Logging**
- ‚úÖ **Complete audit trail**: All backup operations logged
- ‚úÖ **Failed attempt tracking**: Security violations recorded
- ‚úÖ **IP and user agent logging**: Track access sources
- ‚úÖ **Log rotation**: Prevents log files from growing too large

### 4. **Data Integrity**
- ‚úÖ **Backup validation**: Verifies backup file integrity
- ‚úÖ **File age monitoring**: Tracks backup file age
- ‚úÖ **Permission verification**: Ensures correct file permissions
- ‚úÖ **Size verification**: Validates backup file size

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for production
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-64-character-hex-key-here

# Optional security settings
BACKUP_MAX_SIZE=104857600          # 100MB in bytes
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=30           # Keep backups for 30 days
BACKUP_REQUIRE_ADMIN_RESTORE=true  # Only admins can restore
```

### File Permissions
```bash
# Backup directory
chmod 700 /path/to/backups

# Backup files
chmod 600 /path/to/backups/*.sql

# Log files
chmod 600 /path/to/logs/backup-audit.log
```

## üö® Security Best Practices

### 1. **Production Deployment**
- [ ] Set `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable
- [ ] Use strong, unique encryption keys (64 hex characters)
- [ ] Store encryption keys securely (not in code)
- [ ] Regular key rotation (quarterly recommended)
- [ ] Monitor backup audit logs regularly

### 2. **Access Control**
- [ ] Limit backup permissions to essential users only
- [ ] Use principle of least privilege
- [ ] Regular permission audits
- [ ] Implement two-factor authentication for admin users
- [ ] Monitor failed login attempts

### 3. **Backup Storage**
- [ ] Store backups on encrypted drives
- [ ] Use secure network storage (VPN, encrypted connections)
- [ ] Implement backup redundancy (multiple locations)
- [ ] Regular backup testing and restoration drills
- [ ] Secure disposal of old backup files

### 4. **Network Security**
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all backup operations
- [ ] Implement IP whitelisting for admin access
- [ ] Use VPN for remote backup access
- [ ] Regular security updates and patches
- [ ] Network monitoring and intrusion detection

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Audit Log Analysis
```bash
# View recent backup operations
tail -f /path/to/logs/backup-audit.log

# Check for failed attempts
grep "backup_denied" /path/to/logs/backup-audit.log

# Monitor admin restore operations
grep "restore" /path/to/logs/backup-audit.log
```

### Security Alerts
Monitor for these suspicious activities:
- Multiple failed backup attempts
- Unusual backup times or frequencies
- Large backup file sizes
- Access from unexpected IP addresses
- Permission escalation attempts

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Tools

### Backup Integrity Checker
```bash
# Validate all backup files
node server/scripts/validateBackups.js

# Check file permissions
find /path/to/backups -type f ! -perm 600 -ls

# Verify directory permissions
find /path/to/backups -type d ! -perm 700 -ls
```

### Security Scanner
```bash
# Scan for security vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Check for outdated dependencies
npm outdated

# Security linting
npm run lint:security
```

## üìã Security Checklist

### Pre-Production
- [ ] Encryption key configured
- [ ] File permissions set correctly
- [ ] Audit logging enabled
- [ ] Access controls implemented
- [ ] Backup validation working
- [ ] Security monitoring in place

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Review audit logs weekly
- [ ] Test backup restoration monthly
- [ ] Update security patches quarterly
- [ ] Rotate encryption keys quarterly
- [ ] Security training for users annually

### Incident Response
- [ ] Document security incident procedures
- [ ] Maintain incident response team contacts
- [ ] Regular security drills and testing
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures documented
- [ ] Communication plan for security breaches

## üöÄ Advanced Security Features

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] **Encryption at rest**: Encrypt backup files on disk
- [ ] **Digital signatures**: Sign backups for authenticity
- [ ] **Compression with encryption**: Reduce size while securing
- [ ] **Multi-factor authentication**: Additional security layer
- [ ] **Geographic distribution**: Store backups in multiple locations
- [ ] **Automated security scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessments
