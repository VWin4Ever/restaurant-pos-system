## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN PATTERNS

### **Client-Server Architecture**
```
┌─────────────┐         HTTP/HTTPS        ┌─────────────┐
│   CLIENT    │ ◄────────────────────────► │   SERVER    │
│  (React)    │      REST API Calls        │  (Express)  │
│ Port 3000   │                            │  Port 5000  │
└─────────────┘                            └──────┬──────┘
                                                  │
                                                  │ SQL Queries
                                                  ▼
                                           ┌─────────────┐
                                           │  DATABASE   │
                                           │   (MySQL)   │
                                           │  Port 3306  │
                                           └─────────────┘
```

**Why this architecture?**
- **Separation of concerns:** Frontend (presentation) separate from backend (logic)
- **Scalability:** Can scale frontend and backend independently
- **Maintainability:** Changes in one layer don't affect others
- **Security:** Database never exposed to client

---

### **MVC Pattern (Model-View-Controller)**

```
VIEW (React Components)
    ↕
CONTROLLER (Express Routes + Middleware)
    ↕
MODEL (Prisma + MySQL)
```

- **Model:** Data structure and business logic (database)
- **View:** User interface (React components)
- **Controller:** Handles requests, processes data (Express routes)

---

### **RESTful API Design**

Your API follows REST principles:

| HTTP Method | Purpose      | Example Endpoint          | Action                    |
|-------------|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| GET         | Retrieve     | GET /api/products         | Get all products          |
| POST        | Create       | POST /api/orders          | Create new order          |
| PUT         | Update       | PUT /api/products/:id     | Update product            |
| DELETE      | Delete       | DELETE /api/products/:id  | Delete product            |

**REST Principles Used:**
- Resource-based URLs
- HTTP methods for operations
- Stateless communication
- JSON data format
- Status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500)

---

## 🔐 SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION

### **Authentication Flow**

```
1. USER LOGIN
   Username + Password
        ↓
2. SERVER VALIDATES
   - Check user exists
   - Compare hashed password with bcrypt
        ↓
3. SERVER CREATES JWT
   - Payload: { userId, role }
   - Signs with secret key
        ↓
4. CLIENT STORES TOKEN
   - In localStorage
   - In memory (Context)
        ↓
5. SUBSEQUENT REQUESTS
   - Client sends token in header
   - Authorization: Bearer <token>
        ↓
6. SERVER VALIDATES TOKEN
   - Verifies signature
   - Checks expiration
   - Extracts user info
        ↓
7. REQUEST PROCESSED
   - User identified
   - Role-based permissions checked
```

---

### **Authorization (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC)**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              USER                       │
└───────────┬─────────────────────────────┘
            │
    ┌───────┴────────┐
    │                │
    ▼                ▼
┌─────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│ CASHIER │    │  ADMIN   │
└────┬────┘    └────┬─────┘
     │              │
     │              ├─► All Cashier Permissions
     │              │
     ▼              ▼
Can Access:    Can Access:
• Dashboard    • Inventory Management
• Orders       • Menu Management
• Payment      • Table Management
• Reports      • User Management
               • Settings
               • Advanced Reports
```

**How it's implemented:**
- User table has `role` column
- JWT token includes role
- Middleware checks role before allowing access
- Frontend conditionally renders based on role

---

### **Security Measures**

1. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - Using Prisma ORM (parameterized queries)
   - Never concatenate user input into SQL

2. **XSS Prevention**
   - React escapes output by default
   - Validation on input

3. **Password Security**
   - bcrypt with salt
   - Minimum 8 characters (implement if needed)
   - Never stored in plain text

4. **Token Security**
   - JWT secret stored in environment variable
   - Tokens expire after 24 hours
   - Validated on every request

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Prevent brute force attacks
   - Limit requests per time window

---

### **Database Normalization**

Your database follows **Third Normal Form (3NF)**:

1. **First Normal Form (1NF):**
   - No repeating groups
   - Each field contains atomic values

2. **Second Normal Form (2NF):**
   - All non-key attributes fully dependent on primary key
   - No partial dependencies

3. **Third Normal Form (3NF):**
   - No transitive dependencies
   - Non-key attributes depend only on primary key

**Benefits:**
- Reduces data redundancy
- Prevents update anomalies
- Ensures data integrity

---

## 🔄 KEY BUSINESS LOGIC

### **Order Creation Flow**

```
1. User selects table
   ↓
2. User adds products
   ↓
3. VALIDATION:
   - Table available?
   - Products exist?
   - Stock sufficient? (drinks only)
   ↓
4. Calculate total:
   Total = Σ(price × quantity)
   ↓
5. Create order record
   ↓
6. Create order item records
   ↓
7. Update table status → OCCUPIED
   ↓
8. Return success
```

**Key Points:**
- Stock is NOT deducted yet (only validated)
- Table status changes automatically
- Total calculated on server (security)

---

### **Payment Processing Flow**

```
1. User selects pending order
   ↓
2. User chooses payment method
   ↓
3. SERVER PROCESSES:
   ↓
4. Update order status → COMPLETED
   ↓
5. For each drink in order:
   - Deduct from stock
   - Create stock log entry
   ↓
6. Update table status → AVAILABLE
   ↓
7. Generate invoice data
   ↓
8. Return invoice
```

**Key Points:**
- Stock deducted ONLY on payment (not order creation)
- Prevents stock being locked by pending orders
- All changes in single database transaction

---

### **Stock Management Logic**

```
STOCK TRACKED PRODUCTS (Drinks):
├─ Quantity monitored
├─ Validated during order creation
├─ Deducted during payment
└─ Logged every change

NON-TRACKED PRODUCTS (Food):
├─ No quantity tracking
├─ No validation needed
└─ Assume always available
```

**Why separate tracking?**
- Drinks have shelf life, need inventory
- Food prepared fresh, doesn't need tracking
- Reduces complexity

---

### **Profit Calculation**

```
For each product:
  Profit = (Selling Price - Cost Price) × Quantity

For each order:
  Order Profit = Σ(Item Profit)

For reports:
  Total Revenue = Σ(Price × Quantity)
  Total Cost = Σ(Cost × Quantity)
  Total Profit = Revenue - Cost
  Profit Margin % = (Profit / Revenue) × 100
```

**Key Points:**
- Cost tracked per product
- Profit calculated per order
- Aggregated for reports
- Percentage shows efficiency

---

## 🎨 FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE

### **React Component Structure**

```
App.js (Root)
├─ AuthContext (Authentication state)
│
├─ Router
│  ├─ Login Page
│  │
│  ├─ Protected Routes (require auth)
│  │  │
│  │  ├─ Dashboard
│  │  │
│  │  ├─ Orders Module
│  │  │  ├─ Create Order
│  │  │  ├─ Pending Orders
│  │  │  └─ Order History
│  │  │
│  │  ├─ Reports Module (Cashier)
│  │  │  └─ Sales Report
│  │  │
│  │  ├─ Admin Module (admin only)
│  │  │  ├─ Inventory
│  │  │  ├─ Menu/Products
│  │  │  ├─ Tables
│  │  │  ├─ Users
│  │  │  ├─ Advanced Reports
│  │  │  └─ Settings
│  │  │
│  │  └─ Profile
│  │
│  └─ 404 Not Found
```

---

### **State Management**

**Global State (Context API):**
- User authentication data
- JWT token
- User role
- User profile info

**Local State (useState):**
- Form inputs
- Loading states
- Error messages
- UI states (modals, etc.)

**Why Context API?**
- Built into React
- No extra dependencies
- Sufficient for this scale
- Easy to implement

---

### **API Communication**

```javascript
// Pattern used:
axios.get/post/put/delete(url, config)
  .then(response => {
    // Handle success
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle error
  })
```

**Axios Interceptors:**
- Automatically adds JWT token to requests
- Handles authentication errors globally
- Redirects to login if token expired

---

## 🔧 BACKEND ARCHITECTURE

### **Express Middleware Chain**

```
Request
  ↓
1. Body Parser (parse JSON)
  ↓
2. CORS (allow cross-origin)
  ↓
3. Authentication Middleware (verify JWT)
  ↓
4. Permission Middleware (check role)
  ↓
5. Route Handler (business logic)
  ↓
6. Response
  ↓
7. Error Handler (if error)
  ↓
Response to Client
```

---

### **API Endpoints Structure**

```
/api
├─ /auth
│  ├─ POST /login
│  └─ GET /me (get current user)
│
├─ /products
│  ├─ GET /products (all products)
│  ├─ POST /products (create - admin only)
│  ├─ PUT /products/:id (update - admin only)
│  └─ DELETE /products/:id (delete - admin only)
│
├─ /orders
│  ├─ GET /orders (all orders)
│  ├─ GET /orders/pending (pending orders)

## 🎓 ACADEMIC CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED

### **Software Engineering Principles**

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Frontend, backend, database separate
   - Each layer has specific responsibility

2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Reusable components
   - Shared middleware
   - Utility functions

3. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Each function/component does one thing
   - Routes handle one endpoint
   - Components render one piece of UI

4. **Modular Design**
   - Code organized in modules
   - Easy to maintain and extend
   - Can add features without breaking existing

---

### **Database Concepts**

1. **ACID Properties**
   - **Atomicity:** Transactions complete fully or not at all
   - **Consistency:** Data remains valid
   - **Isolation:** Concurrent transactions don't interfere
   - **Durability:** Committed data persists

2. **Referential Integrity**
   - Foreign keys ensure valid relationships
   - Can't delete user with active orders
   - Cascade delete options

3. **Transactions**
   - Multiple operations grouped
   - All succeed or all fail
   - Used in payment processing

---

### **Web Development Concepts**

1. **HTTP Protocol**
   - Request-response model
   - Status codes (200, 401, 404, 500)
   - Headers (Authorization, Content-Type)

2. **RESTful Design**
   - Resources identified by URLs
   - Standard HTTP methods
   - Stateless communication

3. **JSON Data Format**
   - Lightweight data exchange
   - Human-readable
   - JavaScript native

---

### **Security Concepts**

1. **Authentication vs Authorization**
   - **Authentication:** Who are you? (Login)
   - **Authorization:** What can you do? (Permissions)

2. **Token-Based Authentication**
   - Stateless (server doesn't store sessions)
   - Scalable
   - Works across domains

3. **Hashing vs Encryption**
   - **Hashing:** One-way (passwords)
   - **Encryption:** Two-way (sensitive data)

4. **Salt in Password Hashing**
   - Random data added to password
   - Prevents rainbow table attacks
   - Each password has unique hash

---

## 💡 COMMON INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

### **Q: Why did you choose this tech stack?**

**Answer:**
"I chose React for the frontend because of its component-based architecture and efficient rendering. Node.js and Express for the backend allow me to use JavaScript across the stack, improving development efficiency. MySQL provides reliable ACID-compliant data storage essential for financial transactions. Prisma ORM adds type safety and prevents SQL injection. JWT provides scalable stateless authentication, and bcrypt ensures secure password storage."

---

### **Q: How does your system ensure data integrity?**

**Answer:**
"Data integrity is maintained through several mechanisms: MySQL's ACID properties ensure transaction consistency, foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records, Prisma validates data types and relations, server-side validation prevents invalid data, and all critical operations like payment processing use database transactions to ensure all-or-nothing execution."

---

### **Q: How would you scale this system?**

**Answer:**
"The system can scale in multiple ways: Horizontal scaling by deploying multiple server instances behind a load balancer, database optimization through indexing frequently queried fields, implementing caching with Redis for read-heavy operations, database replication for read scaling, and CDN for static assets. The stateless JWT authentication already supports distributed systems."

---

### **Q: What security vulnerabilities exist and how do you prevent them?**

**Answer:**
"Key vulnerabilities and prevention:
- **SQL Injection:** Prevented by Prisma ORM using parameterized queries
- **XSS:** React escapes output by default
- **CSRF:** JWT in headers rather than cookies
- **Brute Force:** Rate limiting on login endpoint
- **Password Exposure:** bcrypt hashing with salt
- **Token Theft:** HTTPS in production, token expiration"

---

### **Q: Why separate stock management for drinks only?**

**Answer:**
"This reflects real restaurant operations. Drinks are bottled inventory with shelf life requiring tracking. Food is prepared fresh to order and doesn't need inventory management. This separation reduces system complexity while addressing the actual business need for beverage inventory control."

---

### **Q: How do you handle concurrent users?**

**Answer:**
"MySQL handles concurrent access through ACID-compliant transactions and row-level locking. Each request is independent, and JWT authentication allows multiple simultaneous authenticated sessions. Critical operations use transactions to prevent race conditions, especially in stock management where we validate availability and deduct atomically."

---

### **Q: What would you add if you had more time?**

**Answer:**
"Future enhancements would include: Real-time updates using WebSockets, automated backup system, comprehensive logging and monitoring, split payment support, kitchen display system integration, mobile app for staff, offline mode with sync, advanced analytics with charts, automated low-stock ordering, and customer-facing menu with QR codes."
