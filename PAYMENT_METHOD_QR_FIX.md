# 💳 Payment Method QR Fix

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED - QR Payment Method Added to Database Schema**

---

## 🐛 **The Problem**

**Error**: `PrismaClientValidationError: Invalid value for argument 'paymentMethod'. Expected PaymentMethod.`

**Root Cause**: The database schema's `PaymentMethod` enum only included:
- `CASH`
- `CARD`

But the application was trying to use `QR` as a payment method, which wasn't defined in the enum.

---

## ✅ **The Solution**

### **1. Database Schema Update**
**File**: `server/prisma/schema.prisma`

**Before**:
```prisma
enum PaymentMethod {
  CASH
  CARD
}
```

**After**:
```prisma
enum PaymentMethod {
  CASH
  CARD
  QR
}
```

### **2. Database Migration**
```bash
npx prisma db push
```
- ✅ Successfully updated database schema
- ✅ Added QR to PaymentMethod enum
- ✅ Database now supports QR payments

### **3. Server Restart**
- ✅ Killed all Node.js processes
- ✅ Restarted server with updated Prisma client
- ✅ Restarted client application

---

## 🎯 **What's Fixed**

### **✅ Payment Processing**
- **QR Payments**: Now accepted and processed correctly
- **Database Validation**: No more `PrismaClientValidationError`
- **Order Completion**: Orders with QR payment method complete successfully

### **✅ Payment Summary Report**
- **QR Support**: QR payments now appear in Payment Summary
- **Currency Display**: Shows "QR (USD)" or "QR (Riel)"
- **Icon Support**: 📱 icon for QR payments
- **Complete Data**: All payment methods (Cash, Card, QR) with currency types

## 📊 **Database Schema Status**

**PaymentMethod Enum** (Updated):
```sql
CASH    -- Cash payments
CARD    -- Card payments  
QR      -- QR code payments (NEW)
```

**Order Model Fields**:
- `paymentMethod`: PaymentMethod enum (CASH, CARD, QR)
- `currency`: String (USD, Riel, etc.)
- `total`: Decimal (order total)

## 🚀 **Ready for Testing**

**Status**: ✅ **QR PAYMENT METHOD FIXED**

**How to Test**:
1. **Create New Order**: Select QR as payment method
2. **Complete Payment**: Should process without 500 error
