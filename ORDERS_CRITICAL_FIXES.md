**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **ALL CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED**

---

## 🔧 **FIXES APPLIED**

### **Fix #1: Payment Method Selector** ✅

**Problem:**
- Payment method was hardcoded to "CARD"
- No user choice between CASH or CARD
- All payments incorrectly logged as CARD

**Solution:**
Added payment method selection dialog with two buttons: CASH and CARD

**Files Modified:**
1. `client/src/components/orders/Orders.js`
2. `client/src/components/common/ConfirmDialog.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
await axios.patch(`/api/orders/${orderId}/pay`, { 
  paymentMethod: 'CARD'  // ❌ Always CARD
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
const paymentMethod = await showPaymentMethodDialog();
if (!paymentMethod) return; // User cancelled

await axios.patch(`/api/orders/${orderId}/pay`, { paymentMethod });
toast.success(`Payment processed successfully via ${paymentMethod}!`);
```

**New Function:**
```javascript
const showPaymentMethodDialog = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setConfirmDialog({
      open: true,
      title: 'Select Payment Method',
      message: 'How would you like to process this payment?',
      confirmText: 'Cash',      // ← Green button
      cancelText: 'Card',       // ← Blue button
      customButtons: true,
      type: 'info',
      onConfirm: () => resolve('CASH'),
      onCancel: () => resolve('CARD'),
      onClose: () => resolve(null)
    });
  });
};
```

**UI:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ℹ️ Select Payment Method                │
│                                          │
│  How would you like to process this      │
│  payment?                                │
│                                          │
│  [💵 Cash]  [💳 Card]                    │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Impact:** ✅ Users can now choose payment method, financial reports will be accurate!

---

### **Fix #2: Tax Display in CreateOrder** ✅

**Problem:**
- Tax was calculated but NOT displayed
- Users couldn't see how much tax they're paying
- Looked like: Subtotal → Discount → Total (missing tax)

**Solution:**
Added tax line in order summary

**File Modified:**
- `client/src/components/orders/CreateOrder.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
<div>Subtotal: $100.00</div>
<!-- ❌ TAX MISSING -->
<div>Discount (10%): -$10.00</div>
<div>Total: $97.65</div>
```

**After:**
```javascript
<div className="flex justify-between text-sm">
  <span>Subtotal</span>
  <span>$100.00</span>
</div>
<div className="flex justify-between text-sm">
  <span>Tax</span>
  <span>${calculateTaxAmount().toFixed(2)}</span>  // ✅ NOW VISIBLE
</div>
<div className="flex justify-between text-sm">
  <span>Discount (10%)</span>
  <span>-$10.00</span>
</div>
<div className="flex justify-between text-xl font-bold">
  <span>Total</span>
  <span>$97.65</span>
</div>
```

**Visual:**
```
Order Summary
─────────────────────
Subtotal      $100.00
Tax            $7.65  ← ✅ NOW VISIBLE
Discount (10%) -$10.00
─────────────────────
Total          $97.65
```

**Impact:** ✅ Transparent pricing, users can see tax breakdown!

---

### **Fix #3: Tax Display in EditOrder** ✅

**Status:** ✅ Already implemented!

**File:** `client/src/components/orders/EditOrder.js:468-470`

Tax was already displayed in EditOrder component. No changes needed.

---

### **Fix #4: Tax Display in Order Details Modal** ✅

**Problem:**
- Order details modal showed: Subtotal, Discount, Total
- Tax was missing from the breakdown

**Solution:**
Added tax line in financial summary

**File Modified:**
- `client/src/components/orders/Orders.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
<div>Subtotal: ${order.subtotal}</div>
{order.discount > 0 && <div>Discount: -${order.discount}</div>}
<!-- ❌ TAX MISSING -->
<div>Total: ${order.total}</div>
```

**After:**
```javascript
<div>Subtotal: ${order.subtotal}</div>
<div>Tax: ${order.tax || 0}</div>  // ✅ ADDED
{order.discount > 0 && <div>Discount: -${order.discount}</div>}
<div>Total: ${order.total}</div>
```

**Impact:** ✅ Complete financial breakdown in order details!

---

### **Fix #5: Business Snapshot JSON Parsing** ✅

**Problem:**
- `businessSnapshot` is stored as STRING in database
- Code used it as OBJECT without parsing
- Would crash when accessing `businessSnapshot.taxRate`

**Solution:**
Added proper JSON parsing with error handling

**File Modified:**
- `server/routes/orders.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
const businessSnapshot = existingOrder.businessSnapshot || await getBusinessSettings();
const taxRate = businessSnapshot.taxRate;  // ❌ STRING.taxRate = undefined!
```

**After:**
```javascript
let businessSnapshot = existingOrder.businessSnapshot;

// Parse business snapshot if it's a string
if (businessSnapshot && typeof businessSnapshot === 'string') {
  try {
    businessSnapshot = JSON.parse(businessSnapshot);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to parse business snapshot:', error);
    businessSnapshot = await getBusinessSettings();
  }
} else if (!businessSnapshot) {
  businessSnapshot = await getBusinessSettings();
}

const taxRate = businessSnapshot.taxRate || 8.5;  // ✅ Works now!
```

**Impact:** ✅ Prevents crashes when editing orders, maintains historical accuracy!
