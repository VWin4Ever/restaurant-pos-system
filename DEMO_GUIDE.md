## üí° Expected Questions & Answers

### **Q: How does the system handle concurrent orders?**
**A:** "The system uses a MySQL database with transaction support, ensuring data consistency even with multiple cashiers working simultaneously."

### **Q: What happens if a drink is out of stock?**
**A:** "The system validates stock availability during order creation. If a drink is out of stock, the cashier receives an alert and cannot complete the order until stock is adjusted."

### **Q: How is profit calculated?**
**A:** "Profit is calculated as Revenue minus Cost. Each product has a cost price and selling price. The system aggregates these across all orders to show total profit."

### **Q: Can the system handle multiple payment methods for one order?**
**A:** "Currently, the system supports one payment method per order, but this could be extended to split payments."

### **Q: How is security implemented?**
**A:** "We use JWT tokens for authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, role-based access control for authorization, and protected API routes on the backend."

### **Q: What database is used and why?**
**A:** "We use MySQL with Prisma ORM. MySQL provides reliability, ACID compliance, and is widely supported. Prisma offers type-safety and easy database migrations."

### **Q: Is the system scalable?**
**A:** "Yes, the architecture separates frontend and backend, allowing independent scaling. The API can handle multiple clients, and the database can be optimized for larger datasets."

### **Q: How do you prevent unauthorized access?**
**A:** "Authentication middleware validates JWT tokens on every protected route. Role-based permissions restrict actions based on user role. All passwords are hashed before storage."

## üö® Quick Troubleshooting

### **Issue: App won't start**
- ‚úÖ Check if MySQL is running in XAMPP
- ‚úÖ Verify database exists: `restaurant_pos`
- ‚úÖ Run: `npm run setup-db`

### **Issue: Can't login**
- ‚úÖ Check browser console for errors
- ‚úÖ Verify backend is running on port 5000
- ‚úÖ Verify credentials:
  - Admin: `admin` / `admin123`
  - Cashier: `cashier` / `cashier123`

### **Issue: Stock not deducting**
- ‚úÖ Ensure product is marked as "stock tracked"
- ‚úÖ Complete the payment process (stock deducts on payment, not order creation)

### **Issue: Tables not updating**
- ‚úÖ Refresh the page
- ‚úÖ Check if order was successfully created/completed
