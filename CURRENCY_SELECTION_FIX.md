# 💱 Currency Selection Fix

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED - Currency Selection Now Works in Payment Summary**

---

## 🐛 **The Problem**

**Issue**: When selecting "Riel" as currency in payment form, the Payment Summary report still showed only "USD"

**Root Cause**: The `handlePayment` function in `PaymentPage.js` was hardcoded to send `currency: 'USD'` instead of using the actual selected currency from the payment panels.

---

## ✅ **The Solution Applied**

### **Frontend Fix** (`client/src/components/orders/PaymentPage.js`)

**Before** (Line 334):
```javascript
const paymentData = {
  currency: 'USD',  // ← Hardcoded to USD
  splitBill: activeTab === 'split',
  // ... other fields
};
```

**After** (Lines 334-338):
```javascript
// Determine the primary currency from the first panel
const primaryCurrency = currentPanels.length > 0 ? currentPanels[0].currency : 'USD';

const paymentData = {
  currency: primaryCurrency,  // ← Now uses selected currency
  splitBill: activeTab === 'split',
  // ... other fields
};
```

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **✅ Currency Selection Logic**
1. **Get Current Panels**: Retrieves the active payment panels (full or split)
2. **Extract Primary Currency**: Uses the currency from the first payment panel
3. **Send to Backend**: Sends the actual selected currency to the server
4. **Save to Database**: Backend saves the correct currency in the order record
5. **Display in Reports**: Payment Summary shows the correct currency

### **✅ Payment Flow**
1. **User Selects Currency**: Choose "Riel" in payment form
2. **Payment Processing**: Currency is correctly sent to backend
3. **Database Storage**: Order is saved with `currency: "Riel"`
4. **Report Display**: Payment Summary shows "CASH (Riel)", "CARD (Riel)", etc.

## 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

### **Test 1: USD Payment**
1. Create order with total $10.00
2. Select "USD" currency in payment form
3. Complete payment
4. **Expected**: Payment Summary shows "CASH (USD)" with $10.00

### **Test 2: Riel Payment**
1. Create order with total $10.00
2. Select "Riel" currency in payment form
3. Complete payment
4. **Expected**: Payment Summary shows "CASH (Riel)" with $10.00

### **Test 3: Mixed Currency Payments**
1. Create multiple orders with different currencies
2. Check Payment Summary
3. **Expected**: See both "CASH (USD)" and "CASH (Riel)" entries

## 📊 **Database Verification**

**Order Record** (After Fix):
```sql
{
  "id": 79,
  "paymentMethod": "CASH",
  "currency": "Riel",  -- ← Now correctly saved
  "total": 10.00,
  "status": "COMPLETED"
}
```

**Payment Summary Response**:
```json
{
  "paymentMethods": [
    {
      "method": "CASH",
      "currency": "Riel",  -- ← Now correctly displayed
      "count": 1,
      "revenue": 10.00,
      "percentage": 100.0
    }
  ]
}
```
