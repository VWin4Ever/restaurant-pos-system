## 💡 Top Tips for Success

### **1. Start Strong**
Your opening statement sets the tone. Memorize it!

### **2. Go Slow**
Better to show fewer features well than rush through everything.

### **3. Explain as You Click**
Narrate what you're doing: "Now I'm creating an order..."

### **4. Use Technical Terms**
Show your knowledge: "JWT authentication", "RESTful API", "RBAC"

### **5. Show Business Value**
Not just technical - explain benefits: "This increases efficiency..."

### **6. Handle Questions Confidently**
If unsure: "That's an excellent question. In a production environment, we would..."

### **7. Stay Calm**
If something breaks, explain what should happen and why it's valuable.

### **8. Time Management**
Keep an eye on time. Have a watch or clock visible.

### **9. Practice**
Run through at least once before the actual demo.

### **10. Be Proud**
You built an impressive system. Show your passion!
